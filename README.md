[Hidden OSINT Application](https://hidden-osint.herokuapp.com/)

# Hidden
An OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Network dedicated towards bringing light to the monstrosities of human trafficking. Created as a non-profit, Hidden allows users to conenct and share relevant intel about missing persons and victims of human trafficking. 

### Inspiration
This project reflects a passion and dedication to combat human trafficking and bring awareness to the severity and cruel reality of the human trafficking market. One source of inspiration to create an OSINT network was the Netflix Documentary "[Don't F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81031373?source=35)" which shows the power of how a group of inspired individuals on the internet spearheaded the manhunt with their FaceBook group, in tracking down a killer. This app serves as a home for like minded individuals like those seen in the documentary, who wish to track down and save victims of human trafficking.
